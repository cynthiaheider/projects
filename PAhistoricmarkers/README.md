This project consists of two (2) files: (1) .csv file; (1) .txt file (documentation)

Source material: The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission has created an [open dataset](https://data.pa.gov/Government-Efficiency-Citizen-Engagement/Pennsylvania-Historical-Markers-Historical-and-Mus/xt8f-pzzz) listing historical markers in the state.

So far I have gleaned a list of historical marker sites in Philadelphia relating to Black music and entertainment history. This dataset was created for Chelsea Reed's public history initiative ["Sounds of the Revolution: Resources for Black Music History in Philadelphia" (bit.ly/soundsoftherev)](http://bit.ly/soundsoftherev). The CSV columns for this dataset include:
Historical Marker ID
Name of the Marker
County
Dedicated Year
Dedicated Month
Dedicated Day
Marker Type
Location Description
Marker Description
Status
Longitude
