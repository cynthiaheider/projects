Source material:
[Annual Report of the Bureau of Health of the City of Philadelphia for the Year Ending December 31, 1918](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.1340flu.0012.431) contains statistics including death due to disease by city ward, from which I created a dataset [Disease Deaths by Ward](https://github.com/cynthiaheider/projects/influenza1918/blob/master/DiseaseDeathsbyWardPhila1918.csv) to visualize with Datawrapper.

I created a [1914 Ward Map of Philadelphia](projects/influenza1918/1914_PhilaWardMap.geojson) from [index maps created by the Free Library of Philadelphia](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KzN_cSo1mFJasI2PpDKWoB3e6XeWuVEC/view). More shapefiles of historical ward maps, street maps, sanitation studies, etc. can be found at the [Historical Urban Ecological Data, 1830-1930](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/35617/datadocumentation) project.

Population figures in [Disease Deaths by Ward Transposed](https://github.com/cynthiaheider/projects/influenza1918/blob/master/DiseaseDeathsbyWardPhila1918-Transposed.csv) were derived from the [1910 U.S. Census](https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/41033935v35-41ch3.pdf).

Some of the resultant data visualizations can be found at my [Datawrapper instance](https://app.datawrapper.de/mycharts/34860).
