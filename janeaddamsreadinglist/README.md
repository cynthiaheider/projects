Documentation -- Jane Addams' Reading List

This project consists of two (2) files: (1) .csv file (1) .txt file (documentation)

Source material: Catalogued collections of books identified as having been part of Jane Addams' personal library at the [University of Illinois at Chicago Library Special Collections](https://library.uic.edu/) (subject search: "Jane Addams Personal Library Collection") and [Swarthmore College Peace Collection](https://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/DG001-025/DG001JAddams/Addams%20Library%20web.htm).

As Swarthmore College notes, most of the personal library of Jane Addams (social reformer, and Hull-House founder, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate) was dispersed when Hull-House was demolished in 1963.

The identified remaining volumes reside in collections at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Swartmore College, and Rockville University. I scraped the catalogue records of the two former institutions and structured the records into tabular data. I was unable to find a listing or catalog records of the volumes stewarded by Rockford University.
