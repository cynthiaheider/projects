This project consists of two (2) files: (1) .csv file; (1) .txt file (documentation)

Source material: [Warrantees of Land in the Several Counties of the State of Pennsylvania, 1730-1898](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/wu.89066123571), ed. William Henry Egle.

I scraped the first chapter of this volume ("Warrantees of Land in the County of Philadelphia, 1733-1866") using Tabula and structured the result using OpenRefine and Excel.

The columns of the CSV include:
1. Original sort order (as listed in the printed volume)
2. Names (arranged Last name, First name, Title). Often this indicates one person, but maybe indicate multiple warrantees.
3. Acres. Often in numeric quantity, but sometimes "city lot," "bank lot," "Liberty land," and other qualifiers. "Null" indicates entries where a value was not given.
4. Month and day of land survey
5. Year of land survey
